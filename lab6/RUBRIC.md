## Questions/Concerns

If you have any generic questions about this rubric, please post it in the
follow up discussion below. For any specific questions (based on your
submission), please follow the directions in your grade report email. I will
only address specific questions that are sent as a reply to your original grade
report email (only exception: if you did not receive one and think you should
have). This is to give me context as to what you are referring to, and your
specific submission information.
